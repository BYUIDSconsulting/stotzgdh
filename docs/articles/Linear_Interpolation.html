<li><p>Test was done over days.</p></li>
<li><p>5 out of 10 locations the linear approach to interpolation is
more accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, the sum of absolute errors was lower for Linear
interpolation.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, we believe using linear interpolation approach
compared to a moving average is best.</p></li>
