Description: Weather is retrieved from HRRR an amazon service. It pulls data for certain 
    chunks where stotz customers are. It converts the temp from Kelvin to Farenheit. Saves 
    data. Then takes data and creates another table which gets the GDH for each crop stotz's
    wants and saves it by the day for every latitude and longitude and saves this file. The
    package also updates both of these files.
